# 4secrets — Wedding Planner

## Overview

4secrets is a comprehensive wedding-planning mobile app designed to help couples plan their big day in a relaxed, organised, and joyful way. The app offers tools for managing every key aspect of wedding planning — from guest lists to budgets, vendors, inspiration, checklists, and schedules — with a focus on collaboration, clarity, and stress-free preparation. 

The app was created by a bridal stylist with over 15 years of experience, aiming to offer the kind of planning support that transforms the often-overwhelming process into a smooth, manageable, and even enjoyable journey.
